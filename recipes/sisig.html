        <h2>Description</h2>    
        <p>Sisig is a <strong><mark>popular Filipino dish</mark></strong> made by boiling, chopping, and grilling parts of pig's head such as ears, cheeks, and jowls, which are then seasoned with salt, pepper, and vinegar. The meat is combined with fried onions, sili, and chicken livers, and the whole concoction is traditionally topped with a raw egg.</p>
        <p>The name of the dish is believed to derive from the word sisigan, meaning to make sour. It was used as an early remedy for nausea and hangovers, because its sour flavor was considered a vomit suppressant, and that is why today sisig is almost always paired with an ice-cold beer on the side.What started as a simple sour salad has crossed land and sea to become one of the <strong><mark>favorite dishes of beer drinkers worldwide.</mark></strong></p>
