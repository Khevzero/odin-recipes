        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lechon, derived from a Spanish word for roasted suckling pig is <strong><mark>one of the most popular dishes in the Philippines.</mark></strong> The slowly-roasted suckling pig is usually stuffed with lemongrass, tamarind, garlic, onions, and chives, and is then roasted on a large bamboo spit over an open fire.</p>  
        <p>It is traditionally served whole on a platter, at celebrations and festive events such as weddings and Christmas. Once the meat is properly roasted and falls off the bone, people tend to eat every part of the pig, and the crispy, reddish-brown, crackling skin is especially beloved. <strong><mark>Some famous chefs even named lechon the best pig in the world,</mark></strong>  so it is definitely worth a try.</p>
