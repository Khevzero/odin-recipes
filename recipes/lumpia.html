        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lumpia is a <strong><mark>simple and flavourful Filipino finger food</mark></strong> that evolved from the Chinese spring rolls. Each lumpia consists of a rice or flour dough wrap that is stuffed with meat (most often ground pork or beef) and vegetables such as cabbage, carrots, onions, and garlic. It is then sealed with egg wash and fried.</p>
        <p>Once it has been prepared, its crusty, crunchy exterior and tender interior are perfectly complemented with the sweet and sour dipping sauce. It can be eaten as a snack or as a side dish, and it is almost impossible to see a Filipino feast without at least one variation of lumpia, such as unfried lumpia, lumpia with bean sprouts, hearts of coconut palm,bangus, or saba bananas (ripe plantains).</p>
